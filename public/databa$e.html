          <h3>Disable Lightspeed</h3>
          <p class="method-description">This method requires a lot of tabs (500-2000+) and disables Lightspeed by overloading it on your chromebook. <br>
            <br>
            REQUIREMENTS:<br>
            -"Manage Extensions" is not blocked, and I do not know if this works on anything other than chromebook. It should work with other devices, but please try it out and let me know.<br>
            -"Bookmark Manager" is not blocked, unless you want to spend hours getting the optimal amount of tabs in a folder.<br>
            <br>
            Here are the steps: <br>
            Open up a blocked website. The URL will be something similar to chrome-extension://adkcpkpghahmbopkjchobieckeoaoeem/block_screen.html?id=... (I'm not going to type the rest of it)<br>
            Copy everything UP TO "/block_screen.html?"<br>
            Create a new folder<br>
            Go to "Bookmark Manager", go to the folder, then hold paste to add the URL into the folder. This is so you can open all of them at once. For me and a few friends, the optimal amount was about 2000 tabs, but depending on your internet speed and device function, this is known to change.<br>
            Right-click on the folder, then open all the tabs IN A NEW WINDOW. Otherwise the next step might be painful<br>
            Switch back to the window you were in before, and KEEP THE LARGE GROUP OF TABS OPEN. Go to "Manage Extensions" and go to "Lightspeed Filter Agent." Scroll down, and toggle "Allow access to URLS"<br>
            Open ONE of the tabs in a new window.<br>
            <br>
            If this method works, the size of the extension should not be loading. If your device crashes in the process, you will have to restart. Optimal amount of tabs for me and a few of my friends is around 2000, but if it crashes, delete tabs so your device can handle it. If Lightspeed loads too quickly, increase the number of tabs opened so it takes longer to load. <br>
